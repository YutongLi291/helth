**You are a broccoli.**

You have just been eaten by someone who is not-so-"helth"-y. Being a broccoli, you wish to leave. However, you also don't want to be pulverized by the evil fat cells in the foreign body you happen to be occupying. Do your best to evade fat particles, and survive for as long as you can in the mess you find yourself in.


**Instructions**

Touch and hold the screen to perform a full jump. Quick tap the screen to perform a shorter jump.
Tap the left side of the screen to jump leftwards, tap the right side of the screen to jump rightwards
If you jump on a fatty solid, you can use it as a platform, to either avoid bullets or jump to other fatty solids.

--On Desktop, press the space bar instead of the screen, and use the left and right arrow keys to modify the lean of your jump

There's an evil cholesterol running around the stage. It wants your brains.

Avoid getting hit by fat particles at all costs.
You have 10 lives. How long can YOU survive?

***Can YOU rock the brocc?***
