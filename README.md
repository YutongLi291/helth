**You are a broccoli.**

You have just been eaten by someone who is not-so-"helth"-y. Being a broccoli, you wish to leave. However, you also don't want to be pulverized by the evil fat cells in the foreign body you happen to be occupying. Do your best to evade fat particles, avoid getting trapped by fatty solids, and survive for as long as you can in the mess you find yourself in.


**Instructions**

Touch and hold the screen to perform a full jump. Quick tap the screen to perform a shorter jump.
If you jump on a fatty solid, you can use it as a platform, to either avoid bullets or jump to other fatty solids.
However, if YOU get hit by a fatty solid, you will be stuck in it for the duration it moves past you. Jump to wiggle free!
-On Desktop, press the space bar instead of the screen

Avoid getting hit by fat particles at all costs.
You have 10 lives. How long can YOU survive?

***Can YOU rock the brocc?***
